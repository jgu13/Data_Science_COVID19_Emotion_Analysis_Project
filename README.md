# Final_Project COVID option:
Characterize the "North American" conversation (rather than Canadian).  To do this, we will use a proxy - filter on the English language and the timezones that cover the Americas.  
This will produce largely US and Canadian content.  There are, of course, serious issues with this (including confusing anglophone conversation with American/Canadian conversation).  
However, given the time available for this project, this will be sufficient to complete the project and work through all the phases of the data science project.
